# 🎬 CineStream API - Film Collection

This repository contains the **Backend API** for CineStream, a movie and series library management project. This API is built with a modern Node.js stack, providing a complete, robust, and scalable CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) interface for managing film and genre data.

The frontend application (which consumes this API) is managed in a separate repository.

## Features

* **RESTful Endpoints:** Full CRUD functionality exposed via clear and semantic HTTP routes.
* **Data Persistence:** Uses **Prisma** as the modern ORM to interact with the database.
* **Database:** Powered by **PostgreSQL** for reliable, relational data storage.
* **Seed Data:** Includes a comprehensive `seed.js` script to populate the database with initial movies, series, and genres.
* **Modular Structure:** Organized using a dedicated `src/controllers`, `src/models`, and `src/routes` pattern for clean, maintainable code.
